# Introduction

`bitECS` is a flexible toolkit for data-oriented design in game development. It offers core ECS concepts without imposing strict rules onto your architecture:

- Entities are numerical IDs.
- Component stores can be anything.
- No formal concept of systems, only queries.

For optimal performance:
- Use a [Structure of Arrays (SoA) format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA) for components.
- Implement systems as a series of functions (function pipeline).

These practices enhance data locality and processing efficiency in your ECS architecture, as well as feature modularity.

```ts
import { createWorld, addEntity, addComponent, addComponents, query } from 'bitecs'

// Define components
const Position = {
	x: [] as number[],
	y: [] as number[],
}

// Create a world
const world = createWorld()

// Add an entity to the world
const entity = addEntity(world)

// Add component to entity
addComponent(world, entity, Position)

// Set initial values for Position component
Position.x[entity] = 0
Position.y[entity] = 0

// Define a system that moves entities with a Position component
const moveEntity = (world) => {
	for (const eid of query(world, [Position])) {
		Position.x[eid] += 1
		Position.y[eid] += 1
	}
}

// Run system in a loop
const mainLoop = () => {
	moveEntity(world)
	requestAnimationFrame(mainLoop)
}

mainLoop()
```

## World

A world is a container for ECS data. Entities are created in a world and data is queried based on the existence and shape of entities in a world. Each world is independent of all others.

```ts
const world = createWorld()
```

### Options

Passing an object to `createWorld` will use the object as a custom context, if desired. `bitECS` will treat the passed-in reference as a world, and the same reference will be returned.

```ts
const context = {
    time: {
        then: 0,
        delta: 0,
    }
}
const world = createWorld(context)
assert(world === context) // true
```

Passing an `entityIndex` uses the entity index to share an EID space between worlds.

```ts
const entityIndex = createEntityIndex()
const worldA = createWorld(entityIndex)
const worldB = createWorld(entityIndex)

addEntity(worldA) // 1
addEntity(worldB) // 2
addEntity(worldA) // 3
```

You can pass either in any order.

```ts
createWorld({ data: 1 }, entityIndex)
createWorld(entityIndex, { data: 1 })
```

## Entity

Entities are unique numerical identifiers, sometimes called entity IDs or eids for short. Entities are unique across all worlds, unless worlds have a shared entity index.

```ts
const eid = addEntity(world)
removeEntity(world, eid)
```

### Entity Utilities

Additional entity management functions:

```ts
// Check if an entity exists
if (entityExists(world, eid)) {
  // Entity is valid
}

// Get all components for an entity
const components = getEntityComponents(world, eid)
```

### Entity ID Recycling

Entity IDs are recycled immediately after removal.

```ts
const eid1 = addEntity(world)
const eid2 = addEntity(world)
removeEntity(world, eid1)
const eid3 = addEntity(world)

assert(eid1 === eid3)
```

### Manual Entity ID Recycling (Recommended)

Manual entity ID recycling lets you control exactly when entities are removed from the world. Instead of immediately recycling entity IDs when removed, you can mark entities for removal and process them later in batches.

`bitECS` removes entities instantly when `removeEntity()` is called, but defers removing them from query results until the next time any query is executed. This means that an entity marked for removal will still appear in current query results but will be flushed from all query results on subsequent query calls. For even more control over entity lifecycle management, you can implement manual recycling patterns to batch removals or handle specific timing requirements. Here's how to implement manual recycling:

```ts
const Removed = {}

const markEntityForRemoval = (world: World, eid: number): void => {
    addComponent(world, eid, Removed)
}

const removeMarkedEntities = (world: World): void => {
    for (const eid of query(world, [Removed])) {
        removeEntity(world, eid)
    }
}

const eid = addEntity(world)
markEntityForRemoval(world, eid)

// sometime later...
removeMarkedEntities(world)
```

### Entity ID Versioning with Entity Index

Entity ID versioning is an alternative mechanism that helps in managing recycled entity IDs more effectively. When versioning is enabled, each entity ID carries a version number that increments every time the ID is recycled. This helps in distinguishing between different lifetimes of the same entity ID, preventing potential issues that arise from immediate recycling.

To enable versioning, pass `withVersioning()` as a first argument, and optionally specify the number of version bits. Version bits determine how many times an ID can be recycled before resetting (default is 12 bits = 4096 recycles).

Using version bits reduces the maximum number of possible entities, since bits are split between versioning and entity IDs. You are free to tune this to best fit your use case. Here are some sensible options:

- 8 bits: 16M entities/256 recycles
- 10 bits: 4M entities/1K recycles
- 12 bits: 1M entities/4K recycles
- 14 bits: 262K entities/16K recycles
- 16 bits: 65K entities/65K recycles

```ts
const entityIndex = createEntityIndex(withVersioning(8))
const world = createWorld(entityIndex)

const eid1 = addEntityId(entityIndex)
const eid2 = addEntityId(entityIndex)
removeEntityId(entityIndex, eid1)
const eid3 = addEntityId(entityIndex)

assert(eid1 !== eid3) // With versioning, eid1 and eid3 will not be the same
```


#### ⚠️ Caution with TypedArrays

When using entity ID versioning, be cautious if you are using the entity ID as an index into a sparse TypedArray. The versioning mechanism will technically change the entity ID by large amounts, which can lead to issues where the entity ID overshoots the length of the TypedArray. This can cause unexpected behavior in your system, because Javascript does not throw when trying to access an index that is out of bounds. Make sure your TypedArrays are large enough, or otherwise just handle recycling manually.


## Component
Components are modular data containers that represent specific attributes of an entity. They define an entity's characteristics by their presence. For instance, separate components might represent position, velocity, and mass.

In `bitECS`, you have flexibility in choosing the data structure for components. Any valid JavaScript reference can serve as a component, with its identity determined by reference. For concise syntax with optimal performance, a [structure of arrays (SoA) format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA) is recommended.


```ts
// A SoA component (recommended for minimal memory footprint)
const Position = {
	x: [] as number[],
	y: [] as number[],
}

// A typed SoA component (recommended for threading and eliminating memory thrash)
const Position = {
	x: new Float64Array(10000),
	y: new Float64Array(10000),
}

// An AoS component (performant so long as the shape is small and there are < 100k objects)
const Position = [] as { x: number; y: number }[]
```


### Associating Components with Worlds

Internally, components are automatically registered with a world when first added to an entity within that world. They can also be explicitly registered with `registerComponent`. However, it is your responsibility as the user to effectively manage the data stores for components in between all worlds in use.

When multiple worlds are in use, there are two general approaches. One for maintaining data store isolation between worlds, and one for sharing data stores between worlds.

1. Define components separately for each world. This approach ensures complete isolation between worlds, as each world maintains its own set of components. This is the default behavior and is recommended for most use cases. Note that component storage is left entirely up to you, and there is no explicit need to store components on a `components` property on the world. You can store them wherever you want.

```ts
// When defined on the world...
const world = createWorld({
    components: { 
        Position: Array(1e5).fill(3).map(n => new Float32Array(n)) 
    }
});

// ...components can then be cleanly destructured from the world
const { Position } = world.components
```

2. If multiple worlds share the same entity index, it becomes possible to share components across these worlds. This controlled approach allows for component stores to be defined globally, while still preserving the overall principle of world separation.

```ts
// When defined globally...
const Position = Array(1e5).fill(3).map(n => new Float32Array(n))

// ...components can be retrieved via importing.
import { Position } from './components'

// if using multiple worlds with global components, you MUST use a shared entity index
const entityIndex = createEntityIndex()
const world1 = createWorld(entityIndex)
const world2 = createWorld(entityIndex)
```

Mutations are then handled manually based on the storage format after adding a component.

```ts
addComponent(world, eid, Position)

// SoA
(Position.x[eid] = 0), (Position.y[eid] = 0)
Position.x[eid] += 1

// AoS
Position[eid] = { x: 0, y: 0 }
Position[eid].x += 1

// Array of Typedarrays
const pos = Position[eid]
pos[0] += 1

// Use a setter (needs to be setup first, see observer docs for more info)
addComponent(world, eid, set(Position, { x: 1, y: 1 }))
```

Removing a component updates the shape immediately.

```ts
// eid gets a shape of [Position, Mass]
addComponent(world, eid, Position)
addComponent(world, eid, Mass)

// Now has a shape of just [Position]
removeComponent(world, eid, Mass)
```

### Component Utilities

Additional component management functions:

```ts
// Register a component (automatic on first addComponent call)
registerComponent(world, Position)

// Register multiple components
registerComponents(world, [Position, Velocity, Mass])

// Check if entity has component
if (hasComponent(world, eid, Position)) {
  // Entity has Position component
}

// Get component data (triggers onGet observers)
const data = getComponent(world, eid, Position)

// Set component data directly (alternative to addComponent with set())
setComponent(world, eid, Position, { x: 10, y: 20 })
```

For multiple components, use the plural versions:

```ts
// Add multiple components at once
addComponents(world, eid, Position, Velocity, Mass)

// Or as an array
addComponents(world, eid, [Position, Velocity, Mass])

// Remove multiple components (removeComponent already supports multiple)
removeComponent(world, eid, Position, Velocity)
// same thing
removeComponents(world, eid, Position, Velocity)
```

## Query

Queries are used to retrieve information from the world, which acts as a dynamic database. You can query for entities based on their components, relationships, or hierarchies. A query returns a list of all entities that match the specified criteria.

```ts
const entities = query(world, [Position, Mass]); // Returns number[]
```

### Query Operators

Queries can be modified using operators to create more complex conditions:

- `And`/`All`: Matches entities that have ALL of the specified components (this is the default behavior)
- `Or`/`Any`: Matches entities that have ANY of the specified components
- `Not`/`None`: Matches entities that have NONE of the specified components

Here are some examples:
```ts
// Match entities with Position AND Velocity
query(world, [Position, Velocity])
query(world, [And(Position, Velocity)])
query(world, [All(Position, Velocity)])

// Match entities with Position OR Velocity
query(world, [Or(Position, Velocity)])

// Match entities with Position but NOT Velocity
query(world, [Position, Not(Velocity)])

// Complex combinations
query(world, [
  Position,                   // Must have Position
  Or(Health, Shield),         // Must have either Health OR Shield
  Not(Stunned, Paralyzed)     // Must NOT have Stunned AND must NOT have Paralyzed
])

// Using Any/All/None aliases
query(world, [
  All(Position, Velocity),    // Same as And()
  Any(Health, Shield),        // Same as Or()
  None(Stunned, Paralyzed)    // Same as Not() 
])

```

### Query Types

#### Hierarchical Queries

Hierarchical queries return entities in **topological order**—parents before children—based on a relation (usually a `ChildOf` relation). Use the `Hierarchy()` or `Cascade()` (alias) term in the components array.

```ts
const ChildOf = createRelation()

// Query all entities that have Position **in hierarchy order**
for (const eid of query(world, [Position, Hierarchy(ChildOf)])) {
    // parent entities are guaranteed to be processed before children
}

// Query entities at a specific depth level
for (const eid of query(world, [Position, Hierarchy(ChildOf, 2)])) {
    // only entities at depth 2 in the hierarchy
}
```

Other helpers:

| helper | description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `query(world, [Position, Hierarchy(ChildOf, depth)])` | All entities exactly at `depth` |
| `getHierarchyDepth(world, eid, ChildOf)`     | Cached depth for a single entity |
| `getMaxHierarchyDepth(world, ChildOf)`       | Current maximum depth of the tree |

The hierarchy system internally caches depth calculations and only recalculates when relation changes occur. Subsequent queries have minimal overhead.

#### Query Options

The `query()` function supports both options objects and query modifiers for configuring behavior:

```ts
// Basic usage
const entities = query(world, [Position, Velocity])

// Options object approach
const entities1 = query(world, [Position], { commit: false })                    // Nested (safe iteration)
const entities2 = query(world, [Position], { buffered: true })                  // Returns Uint32Array  
const entities3 = query(world, [Position], { commit: false, buffered: true })   // Nested + Uint32Array

// Query modifier approach
const entities4 = query(world, [Position], isNested)                            // Safe iteration
const entities5 = query(world, [Position], asBuffer)                           // Returns Uint32Array
const entities6 = query(world, [Position], asBuffer, isNested)                 // Combined modifiers

// Hierarchical queries
const entities7 = query(world, [Position, Hierarchy(ChildOf)])                 // Topological order
const entities8 = query(world, [Position, Hierarchy(ChildOf, 2)])             // Specific depth level
const entities9 = query(world, [Position, Hierarchy(ChildOf)], asBuffer)      // Hierarchy + Uint32Array
```

**Available Options:**
- `commit?: boolean` (default: true) - Whether to commit pending entity removals before querying
- `buffered?: boolean` (default: false) - Return `Uint32Array` instead of `readonly EntityId[]`

**Available Query Modifiers:**
- `asBuffer` - Return results as `Uint32Array` instead of `readonly EntityId[]`
- `isNested` / `noCommit` - Skip committing pending removals (safe for nested iteration)

**Nested Queries for Safe Iteration:**

By default, entity removals are deferred until queries are called. However, calling a query while iterating another query will cause entities to be removed during iteration. Use `isNested` or `noCommit` (alias) modifier or `{ commit: false }` option to prevent this.

```ts
// This triggers entity removals, then queries
for (const entity of query(world, [Position, Velocity])) {
  // This would cause removals during iteration - use nested instead
  for (const innerEntity of query(world, [Mass], { commit: false })) {}
  // Or use the modifier:
  for (const innerEntity of query(world, [Mass], noCommit)) {}
}
```


## Relationships

Relationships in `bitECS` allow you to define how entities are related to each other. This can be useful for scenarios like inventory systems, parent-child hierarchies, exclusive targeting mechanics, and much more. Relations are defined using `createRelation` and can have optional properties for additional behavior.

Note: The relation API is a dual-API. It can either take an options object, or composed with optional composables.

### Defining a Relation

You can create a new type of relationship with or without data properties. Here's an example of defining a relation with data:

```ts
const Contains = createRelation(
	withStore(() => ({ amount: [] as number[] }))
)
// or
const Contains = createRelation({
	store: () => ({ amount: [] as number[] })
})
```

Relations can be queried just like components:

```ts
const ChildOf = createRelation(withAutoRemoveSubject)
const children = query(world, [ChildOf(parent)])
```

### Adding Relationships

To add a relationship between entities, you use addComponent with the relation and the target entity.

```ts
const inventory = addEntity(world)
const gold = addEntity(world)
const silver = addEntity(world)

addComponent(world, inventory, Contains(gold))
Contains(gold).amount[inventory] = 5

addComponent(world, inventory, Contains(silver))
Contains(silver).amount[inventory] = 12
```

### Auto Remove Subject

Relations can be configured to automatically remove the subject entity if the target entity is removed. This is useful for maintaining hierarchies where the existence of a child entity depends on its parent entity.

```ts
const ChildOf = createRelation(withAutoRemoveSubject)
// or
const ChildOf = createRelation({ autoRemoveSubject: true })

const parent = addEntity(world)
const child = addEntity(world)

addComponent(world, child, ChildOf(parent))

removeEntity(world, parent)

assert(entityExists(world, child) === false)
```

In this example, when the parent entity is removed, the child entity is also automatically removed because of the autoRemoveSubject option.

### Exclusive Relationships

Exclusive relationships ensure that each subject entity can only be related to a single target entity at a time.

```ts
const Targeting = createRelation(makeExclusive)
// or
const Targeting = createRelation({ exclusive: true })

const hero = addEntity(world)
const rat = addEntity(world)
const goblin = addEntity(world)

addComponent(world, hero, Targeting(rat))
addComponent(world, hero, Targeting(goblin))

assert(hasComponent(world, hero, Targeting(rat)) === false)
assert(hasComponent(world, hero, Targeting(goblin)) === true)
```

In this example, the hero can only target one entity at a time. When the hero starts targeting the goblin, it stops targeting the rat.

### Get targets of a Relationship for entity

To retrieve all target entities related to a specific entity through a particular relation, you can use the `getRelationTargets` function. This function returns an array of entity IDs that are targets of the specified relation for the given entity.

```ts
const inventory = addEntity(world)
const gold = addEntity(world)
const silver = addEntity(world)

addComponent(world, inventory, Contains(gold))
addComponent(world, inventory, Contains(silver))

const targets = getRelationTargets(world, inventory, Contains); // Returns [gold, silver]
```

### Relationship Wildcards

When querying for relationship pairs, it is often useful to be able to find all instances for a given relationship or target. `'*'` or `Wildcard` can be used to to accomplish this.

```ts
const gold = addEntity(world)
const clothes = addEntity(world)
const arrow = addEntity(world)

const chest = addEntity(world)
const backpack = addEntity(world)
const quiver = addEntity(world)

addComponent(world, chest, Contains(gold))
addComponent(world, backpack, Contains(clothes))
addComponent(world, quiver, Contains(arrow))

query(world, [Contains('*')]); // [chest, backpack, quiver]
query(world, [Contains(Wildcard)]); // [chest, backpack, quiver]
```

### Inverted Wildcard Search

In some cases, you may want to find all components that are related to a specific target entity, regardless of the relationship type. This can be achieved using `Wildcard` relation with the target entity as the argument. For example, if you want to find all components that are related to the entity `earth` in any way, you can use the following query:

```ts
const earth = addEntity(world)
const moon = addEntity(world)
const sun = addEntity(world)

addComponent(world, earth, OrbitedBy(moon))
addComponent(world, earth, IlluminatedBy(sun))

const relatedToEarth = query(world, [Wildcard(earth)]); // Returns [moon, sun]
```

### Wildcard Search on Relations

You can also use wildcards to search for all entities involved in a specific type of relationship, regardless of their role (source or target). This is done by using `Wildcard` with the relation itself:
```ts
const parent1 = addEntity(world)
const parent2 = addEntity(world)
const child1 = addEntity(world)
const child2 = addEntity(world)

addComponent(world, child1, ChildOf(parent1))
addComponent(world, child2, ChildOf(parent2))

// Find all entities that are parents (have children)
const parents = query(world, [Wildcard(ChildOf)]) // Returns [parent1, parent2]

// Find all entities that are children (have parents)
const children = query(world, [ChildOf(Wildcard)]) // Returns [child1, child2]
```

## System

Systems define how entities behave in a data-oriented programming approach. They work by querying for entities with specific components and applying behavior based on those components. This separation of behavior (systems) from data (components) provides flexibility in game design.

While `bitECS` doesn't enforce a specific system implementation, it is recommended to using simple functions that can be chained together. Here's an example:

```ts
const moveBody = (world) => {
	const entities = query(world, [Position])

	for (const entity of entities) {
		Position.x[entity] += 1
		Position.y[entity] += 1
	}
}

const applyGravity = (world) => {
	const entities = query(world, [Position, Mass])
	const gravity = 9.81

	for (const entity of entities) {
		Position.y[entity] -= gravity * Mass.value[entity]
	}
}

const update = () => {
	moveBody(world)
	applyGravity(world)
	requestAnimationFrame(update)
}

update()
```

## Prefabs

Prefabs in `bitECS` allow you to define reusable templates for entities. They can include components and relationships, making it easy to instantiate complex entities with predefined configurations.

```ts
const Gold = addPrefab(world)
```

Components can be added to prefabs, creating a template for entities. When an entity is instantiated from a prefab, it inherits all the components and their initial values from that prefab. This allows you to define a consistent data structure and default values for a category of similar entities:

```ts
const Vitals = { health: [] }
const Animal = addPrefab(world)

addComponent(world, Animal, Vitals)
Vitals.health[Animal] = 100
```

### Inheritance

`bitECS` includes a built-in relationship called `IsA` which is used to indicate that an entity is an instance of a prefab. This relationship helps manage prefab inheritance and component composition effectively.

```ts
// component values will be inherited if onSet and onGet observers are createdfirst
observe(world, onSet(Vitals), (eid, params) => {
    Vitals.health[eid] = params.health
})
observe(world, onGet(Vitals), (eid) => ({ 
    health: Vitals.health[eid] 
}))

const Sheep = addPrefab(world)
addComponent(world, Sheep, IsA(Animal)) // inherits Vitals component
addComponent(world, Sheep, Contains(Wool))
```

### Prefabs and Queries

Prefabs themselves do not appear in queries:

```ts
query(world, [Animal]).length === 0
```

However, entities instantiated from prefabs can be queried using the `IsA` relationship:

```ts
const sheep = addEntity(world)
addComponent(world, sheep, IsA(Sheep))
hasComponent(world, sheep, Contains(Wool)); // Returns true

const wolf = addEntity(world)
addComponent(world, wolf, IsA(Wolf))
hasComponent(world, wolf, Contains(Hide)); // Returns true

// Query instantiated prefabs
query(world, [IsA(Animal)]); // Returns [sheep, wolf]
```

## Observers

The `observe` function allows you to subscribe to changes in entity components.
It provides a way to react to component additions, removals, or updates for entities
that match a specific query.

```typescript
const unsubscribe = observe(world, hook, callback)
```

- `hook`: onAdd, onRemove, onSet, or onGet
- `callback`: Called when the observed event occurs
- `unsubscribe`: Call to stop observing

### Observing component adds and removes

The `onAdd` and `onRemove` hooks can be used with any valid query terms, including components, `Or`, `Not`, and other query operators. This allows for complex observation patterns. Here are some examples:

```typescript
observe(world, onAdd(Position, Not(Velocity)), (eid) => {
    console.log(`Entity ${eid} added with Position and without Velocity`)
})

observe(world, onRemove(Health), (eid) => {
    console.log(`Entity ${eid} removed Health component`)
})
```

### Observing component updates
The `onSet` and `onGet` hooks in `bitECS` allow you to implement custom getters and setters for component data. Each component can have its own `onSet` and `onGet` hooks that control how data is written and read.

These hooks operate at the component level rather than individual properties. When you use the `set` function with `addComponent`, the `onSet` hook for that component is triggered with the entire data object:
```ts
addComponent(world, eid, set(Position, {x:1, y:2}))
```

The `IsA` relation for inheritance requires defining data handling in the component hierarchy. Both `onSet` and `onGet` hooks are needed to effectively propagate changes:

- `onSet`: Defines how data is persisted to the custom data store for an entity
- `onGet`: Determines how data is retrieved from the custom data store for an entity

These hooks are meant to give you a way to interface with custom data structures of your own, ensuring consistent inheritance behavior and proper propagation of data through the hierarchy.

Additionally, they provide a way to enhance modularity in your game or application. By allowing implementation of cross-cutting concerns like logging, validation, or synchronization without modifying core system logic, these hooks promote a more modular design.

Here's an example demonstrating how custom data storage and inheritance are implemented together, along with modularity-enhancing features:

```typescript
// Logging
observe(world, onSet(Position), (eid, params) => {
    console.log(`Position added to ${eid}:`, params)
})

// Computed values
observe(world, onSet(Health), (eid, params) => {
    return { value: Math.max(0, Math.min(100, params.value)) }
})

// Network synchronization
observe(world, onSet(Inventory), (eid, params) => {
    syncWithServer(eid, 'inventory', params)
    return params
})

// Custom AoS data storage
observe(world, onSet(Position), (eid, params) => { Position[eid] = params })
observe(world, onGet(Position), (eid) => Position[eid])
addComponent(world, eid, set(Position, { x: 10, y: 20 }))
```


# Serialization

Serialization is completely decoupled from `bitECS` and instead builds its features externally by utilizing the `bitECS` API. It provides serialization APIs that work synergistically together to handle different serialization needs. These can be imported from `bitecs/serialization`.

All serializers support:
- Efficient binary serialization using TypedArrays or regular arrays
- Mapping between different entity IDs during deserialization

Choose the appropriate serializer based on your specific needs:
- SoA for raw component data transfer (Structure of Arrays)
- AoS for object-like storage patterns (Array of Structures)
- Observer for add/remove entity/component tracking
- Snapshot for complete state capture and restoration

## SoA (Structure of Arrays) Serialization

The SoA serializer operates directly on raw Structure of Arrays (SoA) data structures, without any dependency on `bitECS`. It efficiently serializes component data for network replication and data transfer between systems.

The serializer provides two main functions:

- `createSoASerializer(components)` - Creates a serializer for the given components
- `createSoADeserializer(components)` - Creates a deserializer for the given components

Data type tags can be used to define components with regular arrays, which lets the serializer know what data type to serialize the value in the array as:

- `u8()`, `i8()` - 8-bit unsigned/signed integers
- `u16()`, `i16()` - 16-bit unsigned/signed integers
- `u32()`, `i32()` - 32-bit unsigned/signed integers
- `f32()` - 32-bit floats
- `f64()` - 64-bit floats (default if unspecified)
- `str()` - UTF-8 strings

The type tags are used to annotate regular, non-typed arrays for proper serialization. TypedArrays like `Uint8Array` can be used directly without tags since their type is already known:

```ts
import { createSoASerializer, createSoADeserializer, f32 } from 'bitecs/serialization'

const Position = { x: f32([]), y: f32([]) }
const Velocity = { vx: f32([]), vy: f32([]) }
const Health = new Uint8Array(1e5)

const components = [Position, Velocity, Health]

const serialize = createSoASerializer(components)
const deserialize = createSoADeserializer(components)

const eid = 1

// Add data to components
Position.x[eid] = 10.5; Position.y[eid] = 20.2
Velocity.vx[eid] = 1.3; Velocity.vy[eid] = 2.4
Health[eid] = 100

// Serialize component data for entities
// Usually you would use query results here
const buffer = serialize([eid])

// Zero out components to prepare for deserialization
Position.x[eid] = 0; Position.y[eid] = 0
Velocity.vx[eid] = 0; Velocity.vy[eid] = 0
Health[eid] = 0

// Deserialize back into components
deserialize(buffer)

// Assert component data was deserialized correctly
console.assert(Position.x[eid] === 10.5)
console.assert(Position.y[eid] === 20.2)
console.assert(Velocity.vx[eid] === 1.3)
console.assert(Velocity.vy[eid] === 2.4)
console.assert(Health[eid] === 100)
```

### Strings

String branding enables UTF-8 string serialization using TextEncoder/TextDecoder under the hood.

```ts
import { createSoASerializer, createSoADeserializer, str, array } from 'bitecs/serialization'

const Meta = {
  name: str([]),          // string field
  tags: array(str)        // array of strings
}

const components = [Meta]

const serialize = createSoASerializer(components)
const deserialize = createSoADeserializer(components)

const eid = 1

Meta.name[eid] = 'Player_二'
Meta.tags[eid] = ['alpha', 'βeta', 'γamma']

const buffer = serialize([eid])

Meta.name[eid] = ''
Meta.tags[eid] = []

deserialize(buffer)

console.assert(Meta.name[eid] === 'Player_二')
console.assert(JSON.stringify(Meta.tags[eid]) === JSON.stringify(['alpha', 'βeta', 'γamma']))
```

### ID Mapping

When deserializing data, you may need to map entity IDs from the source data to different IDs in the target world. This is common in scenarios like:

- Network replication where client and server entity IDs differ
- Loading saved games where entity IDs need to be regenerated
- Copying entities between different worlds

ID mapping is supported by passing an optional Map to the deserializer:

```ts
 // Map entity 1 to 10
const idMap = new Map([[1, 10]])

// entity id 1 inside of the packet will have its data written to entity id 10
deserialize(buffer, idMap)
```

### Options

`createSoASerializer(components, options)` and `createSoADeserializer(components, options)` accept the following (AoS uses the exact same options):

- **diff**: boolean
    - When true, only changed values are serialized/deserialized (uses an internal shadow and a change mask per component).
- **buffer**: ArrayBuffer
    - Preallocated backing buffer used during serialization. Defaults to a 100MB buffer. The serializer returns a slice up to the written offset.
- **epsilon**: number
    - Epsilon used for float comparisons in diff mode. Defaults to 0.0001. Only applies to float data.

Example:

```ts
import { createSoASerializer, createSoADeserializer, f32 } from 'bitecs/serialization'

const Position = { x: f32([]), y: f32([]) }
const components = [Position]

const serialize = createSoASerializer(components, {
  diff: true,
  buffer: new ArrayBuffer(1 << 20), // 1MB
  epsilon: 1e-3
})

const deserialize = createSoADeserializer(components, { diff: true })
```

## AoS (Array of Structures) Serialization

The AoS serializer works with components that store object-like data per entity (each entity index holds an object/value). The API mirrors SoA and shares the exact same options.

Functions:

- `createAoSSerializer(components, options?)`
- `createAoSDeserializer(components, options?)`

ID Mapping is also applied at deserialization call time via an optional `Map<number, number>` argument to the returned deserializer function.

```ts
import { createAoSSerializer, createAoSDeserializer } from 'bitecs/serialization'
import { f32, u8, str, array } from 'bitecs/serialization'

// Arrays whose elements are per-entity objects or direct values
const Position = Object.assign([], { x: f32(), y: f32() })
const Health = u8()
const Meta = Object.assign([], { name: str(), tags: array(str) })

const components = [Position, Health, Meta]

const serialize = createAoSSerializer(components, { diff: true })
const deserialize = createAoSDeserializer(components, { diff: true })

// Serialize entities [0, 1]
const buffer = serialize([0, 1])

// Optionally map packet IDs to local IDs on deserialize call
const idMap = new Map([[0, 10], [1, 11]])
deserialize(buffer, idMap)
```
### Array of arrays
The bitECS serialization system supports nested arrays (arrays of arrays) as component properties. This feature allows you to store more complex data structures while maintaining efficient binary serialization.
```ts
export const array = <T extends any[] = []>(type: TypeSymbol | T = f32) => { /*...*/ }
```
The array() function annotates an array to indicate its elements' type for proper serialization:
- array(f32) - Creates an array of 32-bit float values (default)
- array(u8) - Creates an array of 8-bit unsigned integers
- array(str) - Creates an array of UTF-8 strings
- array(array(f32)) - Creates a nested array (array of arrays of floats)

#### Usage Examples:
##### Basic Usage with Primitive Types
```ts
import { createSoASerializer, createSoADeserializer, array, f32 } from 'bitecs/serialization'

// Define a component with an array property
const Waypoints = {
    // Array of coordinate pairs stored as f32 values
    points: array(f32)
}

const components = [Waypoints]

const serialize = createSoASerializer(components)
const deserialize = createSoADeserializer(components)

const eid = 1

// Add array data to component
Waypoints.points[eid] = [10.5, 20.2]

// Serialize component data
const buffer = serialize([eid])

// Zero out component to prepare for deserialization
Waypoints.points[eid] = null

// Deserialize back into component
deserialize(buffer)

// Assert array data was deserialized correctly
console.assert(Waypoints.points[eid].length === 1)
console.assert(Waypoints.points[eid][0] === 10.5)
console.assert(Waypoints.points[eid][1] === 20.2)
```
##### Multi-level Nesting Example
```ts
import { createSoASerializer, createSoADeserializer, array, u8 } from 'bitecs/serialization'

// Define a component with a nested array structure
const Inventory = {
    // Array of inventory pages, each containing arrays of item IDs
    pages: array(array(u8))
}

const components = [Inventory]

const serialize = createSoASerializer(components)
const deserialize = createSoADeserializer(components)

const eid = 1

// Define a complex nested structure
const inventoryData = [
    [1, 2, 3],       // Page 1: items 1, 2, 3
    [10, 20],        // Page 2: items 10, 20
    [100, 101, 102]  // Page 3: items 100, 101, 102
]

// Add the nested array data to component
Inventory.pages[eid] = inventoryData

// Serialize component data for entity
const buffer = serialize([eid])

// Zero out component to prepare for deserialization
Inventory.pages[eid] = []

// Deserialize back into component
deserialize(buffer)

// Assert nested array data was deserialized correctly
console.assert(Inventory.pages[eid].length === 3)
console.assert(Inventory.pages[eid][0].length === 3)
console.assert(Inventory.pages[eid][0][0] === 1)
console.assert(Inventory.pages[eid][0][1] === 2)
console.assert(Inventory.pages[eid][0][2] === 3)
console.assert(Inventory.pages[eid][1].length === 2)
console.assert(Inventory.pages[eid][1][0] === 10)
console.assert(Inventory.pages[eid][1][1] === 20)
console.assert(Inventory.pages[eid][2].length === 3)
console.assert(Inventory.pages[eid][2][0] === 100)
console.assert(Inventory.pages[eid][2][1] === 101)
console.assert(Inventory.pages[eid][2][2] === 102)
```
##### Mixed Component Types Example
```ts
import { createSoASerializer, createSoADeserializer, array, f32, u8, f64 } from 'bitecs/serialization'
const Character = {
    position: array(f64),
    inventory: array(u8),
    skills: array(array(f64))
}

const components = [Character]

const serialize = createSoASerializer(components)
const deserialize = createSoADeserializer(components)

const eid = 1

// Set regular component data
Character.position[eid] = [10.5, 20.4]

// Set array component data
Character.inventory[eid] = [1, 5, 10, 15]

// Set nested array component data
Character.skills[eid] = [
    [1, 5.0, 100.5],  // Skill 1: level 5, 100.5 exp
    [2, 3.0, 50.2],   // Skill 2: level 3, 50.2 exp
    [3, 7.0, 200.8]   // Skill 3: level 7, 200.8 exp
]

// Serialize component data for entity
const buffer = serialize([eid])

// Zero out components to prepare for deserialization
Character.position[eid] = null
Character.inventory[eid] = []
Character.skills[eid] = []

// Deserialize back into components
deserialize(buffer)

// Assert all component data was deserialized correctly
console.assert(JSON.stringify(Character.position[eid]) == JSON.stringify([10.5, 20.4]))
console.assert(JSON.stringify(Character.inventory[eid]) == JSON.stringify([1, 5, 10, 15]))
console.assert(JSON.stringify(Character.skills[eid]) == JSON.stringify([
    [1, 5.0, 100.5],
    [2, 3.0, 50.2],
    [3, 7.0, 200.8]
]))
```
## Observer Serialization

The Observer serializer tracks entity additions/removals and component additions/removals on entities. Unlike SoA serializers, observer serializers do depend on `bitECS`. For full network state synchronization, use it together with the SoA serializer:

1. Observer serializer will track and send entities and components that are added/removed
2. SoA serializer sends the actual component data

This combination efficiently handles both entity/component presence and data synchronization across the network.

Key functions:
- `createObserverSerializer(world, networkTag, components, options?)`
- `createObserverDeserializer(world, networkTag, components, options?)`

The `networkTag` parameter is a component that marks entities for serialization. Only entities with this tag will be included in serialization.

The `components` parameter is an array of components that will be tracked for addition and removal. When a component in this array is added to or removed from an entity with the network tag, it will be included in the serialized data.

```ts
import { addComponent, removeComponent, hasComponent, addEntity, createWorld } from 'bitecs'
import { createObserverSerializer, createObserverDeserializer } from 'bitecs/serialization'

const world = createWorld()
const eid = addEntity(world)

const Position = { x: [] as number[], y: [] as number[] }
const Health = [] as number[]
const Networked = {}

// Create serializers
const serializer = createObserverSerializer(world, Networked, [Position, Health])
const deserializer = createObserverDeserializer(world, Networked, [Position, Health])

// Add some components
addComponent(world, eid, Networked)
addComponent(world, eid, Position)
addComponent(world, eid, Health)

// Serialize changes
const buffer = serializer()

// Reset the state
removeComponent(world, eid, Position)
removeComponent(world, eid, Health)

// Deserialize changes back
deserializer(buffer)

// Verify components were restored
console.assert(hasComponent(world, eid, Position))
console.assert(hasComponent(world, eid, Health))
```

### Options

Observer now uses an options object for parity with SoA/AoS:

```ts
type ObserverSerializerOptions = {
  buffer?: ArrayBuffer
}

type ObserverDeserializerOptions = {
  idMap?: Map<number, number>
}
```

- `createObserverSerializer(world, networkTag, components, { buffer }?)`
    - Optional `buffer: ArrayBuffer` sets the backing buffer for serialization (defaults to 100MB). Returns a slice up to the written offset on each call.
- `createObserverDeserializer(world, networkTag, components, { idMap }?)`
    - Optional initial `idMap` seeds packet→world entity ID mapping. The returned function also accepts an optional per-call override mapping: `deserialize(packet, idMapOverride?)`.

## Snapshot Serialization

The Snapshot serializer captures the complete state of entities and components at a point in time. This is useful for:

- Full state synchronization over the network
- Save game states
- Debugging/replay systems

Key functions:
- `createSnapshotSerializer(world, components)` - Creates a full state serializer
- `createSnapshotDeserializer(world, components)` - Creates a full state deserializer

```ts
import { createWorld, addEntity, addComponent, removeEntity, hasComponent } from 'bitecs'
import { createSnapshotSerializer, createSnapshotDeserializer, f32, u8 } from 'bitecs/serialization'

// Example using Snapshot serializer for full state capture
const world = createWorld()
const eid = addEntity(world)

// Define components with tagged SoA data storage
const Position = { x: f32([]), y: f32([]) }
const Health = u8([])

// Create serializers
const serialize = createSnapshotSerializer(world, [Position, Health])
const deserialize = createSnapshotDeserializer(world, [Position, Health])

// Set up initial state
addComponent(world, eid, Position)
Position.x[eid] = 10
Position.y[eid] = 20

addComponent(world, eid, Health)
Health[eid] = 100

// Serialize full state
const buffer = serialize()

// Clear world state
removeEntity(world, eid)
Position.x[eid] = 0
Position.y[eid] = 0
Health[eid] = 0

// Deserialize state back
deserialize(buffer)

// Verify state was restored
console.assert(hasComponent(world, eid, Position))
console.assert(hasComponent(world, eid, Health))
console.assert(Position.x[eid] === 10)
console.assert(Position.y[eid] === 20)
console.assert(Health[eid] === 100)
```

### Options

- `createSnapshotSerializer(world, components, buffer?)`
    - Optional `buffer: ArrayBuffer` to set the backing buffer (defaults to 100MB). The serializer returns a slice up to the written offset.
- `createSnapshotDeserializer(world, components)`
    - The returned deserializer accepts an optional `Map<number, number>` per call to override/extend the packet→world entity mapping.
